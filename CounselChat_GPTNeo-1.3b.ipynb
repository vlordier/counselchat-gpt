I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child.\n",
      "   The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he's gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she's miles away). He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he's possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like he's in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn't been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that he's still with me and happy with our family, she can’t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn't want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didn't want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it's only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. He's caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn't want me to leave him because I'm the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life.\n",

      " Do you want to leave?  First of all, it sounds like you are in a very difficult situation. I am not saying it is completely impossible to live together, and I am sure you can live a stable, happy life with your husband. What I am trying to say is that if this is the way you feel now, then you may want to consider speaking with a counselor about this. The therapists who I have worked with in the past, as well as your husband, have all stated that they felt betrayed by their own decision to leave their partners. In my opinion, you are being a bit self centered and not thinking about your own needs or desires. Also, even if you are \"unsure\" about the best decision to make, I think your emotions are pretty real right now. If you were to think of yourself in the same way that you think of your husband, maybe you'd have a better understanding of what is really going on. While you may not be happy that you are leaving, it sounds like you need to find out what you want and then create a plan to find it in a stable, way. Your husband is able to travel around the world doing whatever he wants, so maybe the two of you can have a long, rewarding life together with some time alone together.What you can do is talk with a counselor. They will help you clarify your feelings, and find out what you would do if you were married with that type of commitment to another. If it is something that you both feel, you can plan on being together for a few months and then get back together. Even if you are very uncertain at this time, I think you can work through this together and start to rebuild a stronger foundation.I know it sounds harsh and I wonder what type of problem you are having. That being said, I think you are being very brave to share your feelings with the other side of the relationship and especially in these kinds of times. The way you\n",

      "Hi Jayuya, I'm struggling in this moment with my own biases. I have biases that are about respect and every individual's need for and right to respect. Your husband lies, cheats and physically hurts you. He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same. He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours. And now, in an attempt to manipulate and silence you, he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him? There aren't many crumbs of this cake left for you, are there?So, my biases about respect don't make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do; I can't do that, and I don't think either of those things will help you. I'd like to ask you some questions though...Are you happy? Do you know what happy is? Do you know what respect is? Are your children safe? Are your children witnessing violence (because if they are, then they're not safe)? Do you have supports? Do your family and friends know what's happening in your life? Have you ever been to a women's shelter? Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly? That's what I suggest. These are big decisions, you deserve some support. I wish you the best.\n"

      "GENERATED ANSWER:\n",
      " Crying is a normal response when you are upset and you don't know why. There are many reasons for crying, but first check with your therapist to find out why you are crying. If it is another problem then that will lead to your talking about it with a therapist. If it is not a problem then that will help open your mind to talk about whatever is causing your discomfort. Many times, we can control the frequency of our crying to how often we have cried to, but there are also other variables that can influence this such as the length of your therapy. You can also be supportive with your therapist by saying that you feel safe and not embarrassed when you cry during therapy. Also, because you trust your therapist to be your trusted friend and not judge you, it can be important to find a therapist you can trust and can communicate with in this way. I would recommend talking with a couple of different therapists. You do not want someone who knows you will cry, doesn't want to yell and will not accept your crying as part of therapy. There is the right therapist for you.\n",

      "REFERENCE ANSWER:\n",
      "Crying is a natural process when you talk about upsetting things especially in therapy when you are opening up and being so vulnerable. I suggest that you consider how you would feel/respond to someone that was confiding to you and they began to cry. If you felt concerned, supportive and empathetic then you know exactly how us therapists feel when our clients are emotional in sessions. I suggest that you think of times where you have cried and how you felt at that time in public and what would have helped to make you feel less uncomfortable during your tears. I think of crying like any other natural reaction of our body such as sneezing, laughing, coughing. You can't help but do those things and most people won't really judge negatively if you do it in public. Similarly, crying is our body's reaction when we are emotional whether it is tears of joy, from a hilarious joke or from being upset. If you are very uncomfortable about crying but willing to start therapy perhaps you can ask the therapist if you can turn your chair around if you begin crying. This way you are not facing them and can self soothe without worrying about how you physically look at that time.I wish you luck and you should be proud of yourself for starting therapy and I wish you a wonderful journey on this important path that you are embarking on.\n"

      "Hi, Break ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It's important that you don't compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery: 1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them. 2. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, & vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that's what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That's exactly the same when it comes to emotional pain. Take care of yourself, keep yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster. 3. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind.\" 4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it's time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new. 5. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders. 6. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.\n",

      "Dealing with a breakup is difficult. We have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. First, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. If we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. So in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. Instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. The second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. You might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. When we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. Lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. This is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. If you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning.

      "It is normal for people to feel nervous and shaky during sessions. Nervousness is part of life and can be uncomfortable. However, it is not a signal that someone is at risk for committing a crime. If someone feels they are at risk for committing a crime and anxiety is the reason, then it could simply be anxiety about doing things they enjoy or experiencing the feeling of being able to do certain things. This is simply a feeling and does not need to be a problem. If someone believes they are a danger and anxiety is the problem, then it may not be a problem at all, especially if their therapist can find a way to help them focus on the positive aspects of their lives without worrying about whether they are a danger to society. There are many people with anxiety problems who have found out through their own efforts that living a relatively positive life can be greatly enhance their lives. Some people find that therapy to focus on ways to manage anxiety reduces their symptoms and anxiety reduces. It is not uncommon for people to see positive results on this in the early days of therapy. Also, as we mentioned before, it is ok to talk about feelings and thoughts and even if you feel uncomfortable with their conversation. The bottom line is that it is normal to have some type of feeling about doing therapy. Your therapist is there to assist you to start living more in the present day, more deeply rooted in the present, and create a clearer sense of how you will respond if there are more pressing issues, such as dealing with specific concerns, or money and money management. Sometimes people will feel nervous or overwhelmed and their therapist will be able to help them to decrease or shift these feelings and to receive the information they need.\n",

      " Although therapy can have a very therapeutic effect for many people, this anxiety can be somewhat distressing and very normal. Our bodies are in constant need of the right level of oxygen, and if the body's not working well, this will most likely set off an anxiety response. Therapy should be a journey rather than a straight run. Talking about stress management is very helpful as anxiety decreases when people feel better about themselves and their lives.\n",

      "I would be more concerned with how is this being addressed in therapy. Therapy can be a rewarding process, however often times we do not pay much attention to the messages being sent to our bodies. I believe in somatic therapy which deals with our mind & body connection. I would think it may not be a question of normal or abnormal however if it is impacting you then you must pay attention to that. It would be helpful to explore the feelings you're having  with your therapist. It may be something that needs addressing to help alleviate those feelings or have a better understanding of why they are showing up when it is time for therapy.\n",

      " yes it is normal to be nervous and anxious about attending therapy. I wonder how you may be feeling each time you walk in to a room to start working. Sometimes we are slightly anxious and nervous about what to expect, so we pace ourselves while we are there. These exercises can help. Another great resource for getting a sense of yourself in a therapy room is Reading through my book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective people which I wrote about that teaches you to use the strength of your intuition and creative skills to help you explore your problems. Often times the person will discuss the overall issue with his therapist. It is important to learn to trust your own intuition and not to wonder what may be going on when others do not.\n",

      "You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.\n",

      "Hi Florida,I get the sense that, aside from this relationship, you're quite isolated in general. It's sad that you're feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events. While I would suggest that you don't really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling (you assume they're against you, and that he doesn't care), he is certainly behaving in a very distant, excluding manner and it's understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt. How long has this part been happening? Has he always acted this way, or is it more recent? Did something happen recently? You mentioned doing \"stupid things to yourself\", and I don't know what that means. If you are engaging in self-harm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this. Part of the problem, of course, is that you don't know what's going on for him. Certainly, you deserve the truth, and if he doesn't want to spend time with you, I would hope he would be honest. Have you been open to hearing the truth from him? Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why he's being distant? Maybe you could ask him, if you are ready to hear.I'm glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full, loving relationship, although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you. Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man? I'm just guessing, based on what you've said here.  It seems that it's possible your situation has led to some depression, and I would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out. You will need support, even if the relationship is repaired. Best of luck.\n"
